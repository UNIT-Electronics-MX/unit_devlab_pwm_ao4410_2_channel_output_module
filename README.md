# UNIT PWM Module

This two-channel PWM module PCB is designed to amplify pulse-width modulation signals generated by a microcontroller, enabling the switching of external loads at voltages and currents well above the microcontrollerâ€™s native limits. 


# Description 

Its compact layout and clearly labeled screw-terminal connectors make it **ideal for applications** such as motor speed control, high-power LED dimming, or any project that demands precise power regulation via PWM.

Additionally, it features a **QWIIC-compatible** 4-pin header for plug-and-play wiring and daisy-chaining power and PWM signals with standard Qwiic cables.
